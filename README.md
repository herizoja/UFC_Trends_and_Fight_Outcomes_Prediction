# UFC_Trends_and_Fight_Outcomes_Prediction
As an MMA fan, I explored UFC data analytics to predict fight outcomes based on historical trends. Using Python for data cleaning, feature engineering, and analysis, and Tableau for visualizations, I examined two UFC datasets. This project combined my passion for MMA with data skills, uncovering patterns for future fight predictions.

Objectives:

- Analyze trends in UFC events, fighters, and fight outcomes over time.
- Perform regression analysis to predict fight outcomes or other relevant metrics.
- Create actionable insights and compelling visualizations to present findings.

Tools Used:

Python for data cleaning, analysis, and regression modeling.
Tableau for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.

Research Questions:

- What trends can be observed in UFC events over time?
- Which weight classes and fighters are most dominant?
- What are the most common methods of victory?
- How do fighter statistics correlate with victory?
- Can we predict fight outcomes using regression analysis?

Proposed Hypothesis:

- The number of UFC events has steadily increased over time, with specific locations hosting more events due to their popularity or regional growth of the sport.
- Specific weight classes, such as Lightweight and Heavyweight, have the most fights and victories due to their historical significance and popularity. Certain fighters will have significantly higher win ratios.
- KO/TKO is the most common victory method in the UFC, especially in heavier weight classes.
- Fighters with longer reach and younger age are more likely to win due to physical advantages and endurance.
- Fighters with longer reach, higher win ratios, and lighter weight classes are more likely to win by KO/TKO.
